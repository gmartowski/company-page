    "experience": "I became interested in programming in 2011, still in college. I started as a web publisher in a large corporation, later in several smaller companies as a Web Developer. I worked on both business applications based on the Zend, Symfony and Laravel frameworks, and I did static pages based on CMS Wordpress in cooperation with graphics. From 4 years on B2B, and from 3 as Front-end Developer. After the initial adventures with jQuery and AngularJS, I focused on working with the ReactJS framework.",
    "codingIsFun": "Programming is not only a job for me, but also great fun! After starting the adventure with React, I think that geography can be really nice.",
    "interestedIn": "In my free time I devote myself to a different passion - photography, I also like football very much, which I have been playing regularly for over 20 years :) If you listen to ambient or synth-wave / pop, you like Star Trek, and Blade Runner's climate is epic for you It's even though I'm an introvert that you can have a different impression."
